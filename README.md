# Pathfinding_Algorithms

This is a react app to visualize few pathfinding algorithms. Following algorithms are implemented in the react app
1. Dijkstra
2. Breadth first search.
3. Depth first search.
4. A-star algorithm.
5. Best first Search.

Special thanks to [link](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) whose was the inspiration behind making this app completely in React JS.
